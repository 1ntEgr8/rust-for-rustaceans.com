You can hear Jon talk about the book on the [Are We Podcast Yet podcast]
as well as on [Rustacean Station]. No Starch (the publisher) also
conducted a [longer text-based interview][nostarch]. If you're after a
quick survey of Jon's writing process, give his [Writes With interview]
a read.

Errata for the book is listed [further down on this page](#errata). If
you spot what you believe to be an error, submit a PR adding it to the
`_errata` folder in [the repository for this site] ([example]).
